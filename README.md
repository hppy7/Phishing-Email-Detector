## Overview
The Phishing Email Detector employs various machine learning algorithms to classify emails as phishing or legitimate. By preprocessing email data and extracting relevant features, the model can effectively identify potentially harmful emails.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email data to extract relevant features.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- User-friendly interface for making predictions on new emails.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK or SpaCy (for NLP tasks)
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-email-detector.git
   cd phishing-email-detector
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage


Preprocess the Data: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the email dataset.
python preprocess.py
Train the Model: Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
python train.py
Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict whether a new email is phishing or not.
python predict.py
